    <p><b>Bio:</b> I am a girl who codes from A city in the world, CA. I will be in a grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to something or another. I live at home with my mom, my sister, and my dogs named something that's not your business. 
	When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to edgy music with my nonexistent friends, reading, or doing some random stuff that you don't need to know. .</p>

    <p><b>Likes:</b> I love Food. My favorite book is a heartbreaking novel called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Light-We-Cannot-See/dp/1501173219">All the Light We Cannot See</a>, by Anthony Doerr. <br>
      <b>Dislikes:</b> I particuarlly dislike people, especially crowds, and when people antisocial instead of asocial. Please expand your vocabulary!<br>

      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> So far, I have eaten a lot of peanut butter today.<br></p>
    
      <p><b>Favorite Websites:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://google.com/">Google</a>: A good search engine. Quick and easy to use, but sometimes frustrating when you try to specify</li>
        <li><a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd.com</a>: I don't have another website, so here you go. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>: Coancer. Just pure, unadulterated, ugly, ugly fandoms. It's entertaining</li>
    </ul>

      <b>Side Scroller Project</b><br>
      Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!<br><br>
